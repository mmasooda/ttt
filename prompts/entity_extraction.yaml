validation_rules:
  - "All entities must have name, type, confidence (0.0-1.0), and context"
  - "Relationships must have source, target, type, and confidence"
  - "Confidence scores should reflect extraction certainty"
  - "Context should provide supporting evidence for entity extraction"
  - "Focus on fire alarm domain-specific entities and relationships"
